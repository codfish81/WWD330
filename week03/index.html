    <ul>
      <li>
        <a>Week 3 notes/exercises</a> - 
        function doSomething() {
          alert('You Clicked!');
          }
          
          addEventListener('click',doSomething);
          Note that the parentheses are not placed after the function when it's used as the argument to an event listener; 
          otherwise, the function will actually be called when the event listener is set, instead of when the event happens!

           it was working quiet right in the example code that I was writing.

            After reading the two articles about "this", I still am little unclear about how it works?
