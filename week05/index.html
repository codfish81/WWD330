          <li>
            I use VS code and not the command line. It seems like some of the exercises in the book want us to use command line, 
            and when I try to do them in VS code nothing happens or it those an error. Is it more beneficial to use the command 
            line? (For example, it tells us to install jest, can i do that in VS code?)
